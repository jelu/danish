Description: DANE TLSA record type tool
 The danish tool helps users by generating TLSA records and by checking certain
 properties of certificates. The tool was specifically designed to be integrated
 into an automated DNS zone generation chain. Apart from being able to generate
 TLSA records from X.509 certificates danish is also able to:
 .
 - Check if a certificate has expired
 - Check if the hostname for which a TLSA record is created matches with the
   certificate
 - Check if a certificate matches with the certificate signing request (CSR)
   used to to request the certificate from a certificate authority
